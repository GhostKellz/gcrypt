# Acknowledgments

gcrypt stands on the shoulders of giants. We acknowledge and thank the following projects and researchers for their foundational work.

## Reference Implementations

### curve25519-dalek
gcrypt was developed with **curve25519-dalek** as a primary reference implementation for mathematical correctness and algorithmic approaches. The excellent work by the curve25519-dalek team provided invaluable guidance for:

- Field arithmetic implementation patterns
- Point operation algorithms  
- Scalar arithmetic and reduction techniques
- Test vector validation approaches
- API design considerations

**Repository:** https://github.com/dalek-cryptography/curve25519-dalek  
**Authors:** Isis Lovecruft, Henry de Valence, and contributors  
**License:** BSD 3-Clause

We deeply appreciate their commitment to high-quality, well-documented cryptographic implementations that serve as exemplars for the Rust cryptography ecosystem.

### ed25519-consensus (eed21115-dev)
Special thanks to **eed21115-dev** and the ed25519-consensus project for additional insights into Ed25519 implementation details and consensus-critical signature verification.
