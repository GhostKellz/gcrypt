## License Overview

### Dual Licensing

gcrypt is dual-licensed under:
- **MIT License** - Permissive, simple, widely compatible
- **Apache License 2.0** - Permissive with patent grant

Users may choose either license based on their needs:
- Choose **MIT** for maximum compatibility and simplicity
- Choose **Apache 2.0** for explicit patent protection

### License Compatibility

gcrypt can be used in:
- ‚úÖ Open source projects (any OSI-approved license)
- ‚úÖ Proprietary/commercial software
- ‚úÖ GPL-licensed projects (via MIT license)
- ‚úÖ Apache-licensed projects
- ‚úÖ Embedded systems
- ‚úÖ Cloud services

### Attribution Requirements

**MIT License**: Include copyright notice and permission notice
**Apache 2.0**: Include copyright notice, license copy, and NOTICE file (if applicable)

## Export Compliance

### U.S. Export Classification

gcrypt implements publicly available cryptographic algorithms and is classified as:
- **ECCN**: 5D002 (publicly available encryption software)
- **License Exception**: TSU (Technology and Software - Unrestricted)

### Notification Requirements

As open-source cryptographic software, gcrypt qualifies for:
- TSU exception under EAR 740.13(e)
- No BIS notification required for public domain software
- Self-classification as 5D002 with TSU exception

### International Compliance

**Wassenaar Arrangement**: Category 5, Part 2 (Information Security)
- Publicly available software exception applies
- No export license required for public domain

**Country-Specific Restrictions**:
- üö´ Not for export to embargoed countries (see current OFAC list)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Some countries restrict cryptographic imports (check local laws)
- ‚úÖ EU: No restrictions for open-source cryptography
- ‚úÖ Most countries: Legal for publicly available software

### Compliance Statement

```
This software contains cryptographic functionality. The export of this
software may be restricted by the laws and regulations of your country.
It is the responsibility of any user of this software to ensure compliance
with all applicable export control laws and regulations.

The cryptographic algorithms implemented are:
- Curve25519 (key exchange)
- Ed25519 (digital signatures)
- X25519 (ECDH)
- SHA-512 (hashing)

All algorithms are publicly published and widely available.
```

## Patent Considerations

### Patent Status

To the best of our knowledge:
- **Curve25519**: No known patents, designed to avoid patent issues
- **Ed25519**: No known patents, uses publicly available algorithms
- **X25519**: No known patents
- **Ristretto**: No known patents

### Patent Grant (Apache 2.0)

Users choosing Apache 2.0 license receive:
- Express patent grant from all contributors
- Protection against patent litigation
- Automatic license termination for patent aggressors

### Defensive Publication

This software serves as prior art for:
- Implementation techniques described herein
- Optimization methods documented
- API design patterns

## Dependency Licensing

### Direct Dependencies

| Crate | Version | License | Type | Notes |
|-------|---------|---------|------|-------|
| subtle | 2.5 | BSD-3-Clause | Required | Constant-time utilities |
| rand_core | 0.6 | MIT/Apache-2.0 | Optional | RNG traits |
| zeroize | 1.7 | MIT/Apache-2.0 | Optional | Secure memory clearing |
| serde | 1.0 | MIT/Apache-2.0 | Optional | Serialization |
| cfg-if | 1.0 | MIT/Apache-2.0 | Required | Conditional compilation |

### License Compatibility Matrix

| Your License | MIT | Apache-2.0 | GPL-2.0 | GPL-3.0 | BSD | Proprietary |
|--------------|-----|------------|---------|---------|-----|-------------|
| Can Use gcrypt | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ* | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ |

*Via MIT license option

### Transitive Dependencies
