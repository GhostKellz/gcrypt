## Features

### Core Cryptographic Primitives

- **Scalar arithmetic** modulo the order of the Curve25519 group
- **Edwards25519** point operations for digital signatures (Ed25519)
- **Montgomery form** operations for key exchange (X25519)
- **Ristretto255** prime-order group for advanced protocols
- **Field arithmetic** over GF(2^255 - 19)

### Modern API Design

- Clean, ergonomic APIs with builder patterns
- Comprehensive error handling
- Rich trait ecosystem for extensibility
- Optional allocator support for no-std environments

### Security Features

- Constant-time arithmetic operations
- Secure random number generation (optional)
- Memory zeroing support with `zeroize` feature
- Side-channel resistant implementations

## Quick Start

Add gcrypt to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
gcrypt = "0.1"
```

### Basic Usage

```rust
use gcrypt::{Scalar, EdwardsPoint, MontgomeryPoint};

// Generate a random scalar
let secret = Scalar::random(&mut rand::thread_rng());

// Edwards curve operations (Ed25519)
let public_key = EdwardsPoint::mul_base(&secret);
let signature_point = &public_key * &secret;

// Montgomery curve operations (X25519)
let shared_secret = MontgomeryPoint::mul_base(&secret);

// Point compression and decompression
let compressed = public_key.compress();
let decompressed = compressed.decompress().unwrap();
assert_eq!(public_key, decompressed);
```

### X25519 Key Exchange

```rust
use gcrypt::montgomery::{MontgomeryPoint, x25519};

// Alice generates a key pair
let alice_secret = [0x77; 32]; // In practice, use random bytes
let alice_public = MontgomeryPoint::mul_base_clamped(alice_secret);

// Bob generates a key pair  
let bob_secret = [0x88; 32]; // In practice, use random bytes
let bob_public = MontgomeryPoint::mul_base_clamped(bob_secret);

// Both parties compute the same shared secret
let alice_shared = x25519(alice_secret, bob_public.to_bytes());
let bob_shared = x25519(bob_secret, alice_public.to_bytes());

assert_eq!(alice_shared, bob_shared);
```

### Ristretto255 Group Operations

```rust
use gcrypt::{RistrettoPoint, Scalar};

// Ristretto255 provides a prime-order group
let basepoint = RistrettoPoint::basepoint();
let scalar1 = Scalar::random(&mut rand::thread_rng());
let scalar2 = Scalar::random(&mut rand::thread_rng());

// Group operations
let point1 = &basepoint * &scalar1;
let point2 = &basepoint * &scalar2;
let sum = &point1 + &point2;

// Verify linearity
let scalar_sum = &scalar1 + &scalar2;
let expected = &basepoint * &scalar_sum;
assert_eq!(sum, expected);
```

## Feature Flags

- `std` (default): Enable standard library support
- `alloc` (default): Enable allocator support for no-std environments  
- `rand_core` (default): Enable random number generation
- `serde`: Enable serialization/deserialization support
- `zeroize`: Enable secure memory zeroing
- `group`: Enable compatibility with the `group` trait ecosystem
- `precomputed-tables`: Enable precomputed lookup tables for faster operations

## No-std Usage

gcrypt supports no-std environments:

```toml
[dependencies]
gcrypt = { version = "0.1", default-features = false }
```

For no-std with allocation:

```toml
[dependencies]
gcrypt = { version = "0.1", default-features = false, features = ["alloc"] }
```

## Performance

gcrypt is designed for high performance:

- **Backend selection**: Automatically chooses optimal implementation based on target architecture
- **Constant-time operations**: All operations are constant-time without sacrificing performance
- **SIMD support**: Takes advantage of vector instructions when available
- **Precomputed tables**: Optional lookup tables for faster fixed-base scalar multiplication

Benchmarks can be run with:

```bash
cargo bench
```

## Security

Security is a primary focus of gcrypt:

- **Constant-time implementations**: All operations resist timing attacks
- **Memory safety**: Written in safe Rust
- **Secure defaults**: Sensible defaults that promote secure usage
- **Regular audits**: Code is regularly reviewed for security issues

### Reporting Security Issues

If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it privately to [security@your-org.com](mailto:security@your-org.com).
